# Services

Archi supports several **services** — containerized applications that interact with the AI pipelines. Services are enabled at deploy time with the `--services` flag.

```bash
archi create [...] --services chatbot,uploader,grafana
```

List all available services with:

```bash
archi list-services
```

## Service Status Board & Alert Banners

The Service Status Board (SSB) is a built-in feature of the Chat Interface that lets designated operators communicate service health, planned downtime, known issues, and general announcements directly to all users — without external tooling.

### How It Works

**Alert banners** appear as colour-coded strips at the top of every page in the chat app. Up to 5 active alerts are displayed at once. Each banner can be individually dismissed by the user client-side. A **details** link redirects to the full status board.

The **Status Board** at `/ssb/status` provides:

- **Active Alerts** — non-expired alerts with severity badges, creator, and timestamp
- **Expired Alerts** — historical record shown at reduced opacity
- **Post New Alert form** — visible only to configured alert managers

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Colour | Intended Use |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| `alarm` | Red | Service outage or critical failure |
| `warning` | Amber | Degraded performance, elevated error rate |
| `news` | Blue | Release notes, planned maintenance |
| `info` | Slate | General informational notices |

### Creating and Deleting Alerts

Navigate to **Status** in the main chat header (or go to `/ssb/status` directly). The **Post New Alert** form is shown to users who have alert manager access. Fill in:

- **Message** (required) — short text shown in the banner
- **Severity** (required) — one of `alarm`, `warning`, `news`, `info`
- **Description** (optional) — longer explanation shown only on the status page
- **Expires at** (optional) — datetime after which the alert is hidden from banners; expired alerts remain visible in the status board history

To delete an alert, click the **Delete** button on its card on the status board. Deletion is permanent.

Alerts can also be created via the REST API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7861/api/ssb/alerts \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "severity": "warning",
    "message": "Embedding pipeline running — responses may be slower than usual",
    "description": "Optional longer explanation shown on the status board.",
    "expires_in_hours": 4
  }'
```

Or with an explicit expiry timestamp:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7861/api/ssb/alerts \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "severity": "alarm",
    "message": "Model backend unavailable",
    "expires_at": "2026-02-21T18:00:00"
  }'
```

### API Endpoints

| Method | Route | Auth Required | Description |
|--------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/ssb/status` | Any authenticated user | Render the status board page |
| `POST` | `/api/ssb/alerts` | Alert managers only | Create a new alert |
| `DELETE` | `/api/ssb/alerts/<id>` | Alert managers only | Delete an alert by ID |

### Access Control

Alert managers are configured via `services.chat_app.alerts.managers` (username list) or the `alerts:manage` RBAC permission. The rules are:

1. **Auth disabled** → everyone may create and delete alerts.
2. **Auth enabled** → a user is an alert manager if **either**:
    - their username is in the `alerts.managers` list, **or**
    - their session roles grant the `alerts:manage` permission.
3. **Auth enabled, no username match, no `alerts:manage` permission** → nobody may manage (safe default; a warning is logged).

All users can always *view* alerts and the status board regardless of access level.

```yaml
# Username-based access (backwards compatible):
services:
  chat_app:
    alerts:
      managers:
        - alice
        - bob

# Role-based access (can be combined with the above):
services:
  chat_app:
    auth:
      auth_roles:
        roles:
          ops-team:
            permissions:
              - alerts:manage
```

See [Configuration → `services.chat_app.alerts`](configuration.md#serviceschat_appalerts) for the full reference.

## Document Upload

Document upload is exposed in the chat UI and backed by the **Data Manager** service. Documents can be uploaded via the web interface or by copying files directly into the data directory.

See [Data Sources — Adding Documents Manually](data_sources.md#adding-documents-manually) for setup instructions.

## Data Manager

A background service that handles data ingestion, vectorstore management, and scheduled re-scraping. It is automatically started with most deployments.

**Default port:** `7871`

### Features

- Orchestrates all data collectors (links, git, JIRA, Redmine)
- Manages the vectorstore (chunking, embedding, indexing)
- Provides a scheduling system for periodic re-ingestion
- Exposes API endpoints for ingestion status and schedule management

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/ingestion/status` | GET | Current ingestion progress |
| `/api/reload-schedules` | POST | Trigger schedule reload from database |
| `/api/schedules` | GET | Current schedule status |

### Configuration

```yaml
services:
  data_manager:
    port: 7871
    external_port: 7871

## Grafana Monitoring

Monitor system performance and LLM usage with a pre-configured Grafana dashboard.
