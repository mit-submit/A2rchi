"""Cache preflight/health report helpers for optional cache-backed sources.

Ported from okg-deployments ``cms/cms_sources/_cache.py`` at
``main@f33a9c4`` (req.w2.sources-catalogs) — the ``cache_preflight_result``
/ ``cache_source_health`` pair that ``archi/auth/cache.py`` deliberately
left behind ("they move with the source ports that consume them").
Consumed by :mod:`archi.sources.dbs`, :mod:`archi.sources.conddb`, and
:mod:`archi.sources.wmstats`. Only change from the original: path
resolution takes the explicit ``base`` argument of
:func:`archi.auth.cache.resolve_repo_path` instead of assuming a
deployments-repo checkout.

Archi deviation (circleback-fixes): :func:`skipped_items_status` is new
— it is the shared policy for item-level parse tolerance. Sources that
skip unparseable cached items must not claim a completed scope over the
survivors (``missing_from_completed_scope`` would retract every record
the drifted items used to produce), and zero parsed records from a
non-empty payload is an endpoint failure rather than an empty success.
Also consumed by the inline-health catalog sources (cmssw, dqm, gocdb,
indico, hypernews).
