"""The shipped bridges must compose verbatim on every consumer.

W3's done-clause is "the cern-team bundle and the comp-ops instance compose the
same files without divergence". Before this test both consumers hand-pruned
`bridges/operations.yaml` -- and pruned *differently* -- because narrowings
whose endpoint subtypes come from modules a consumer does not load raised
`bridge_subtype_unknown` at catalog load.

`optional_when_subtypes_missing: 'true'` makes the composer skip such a
narrowing instead of failing (modules_compose.py: the row is never appended, so
it never reaches `_validate_narrowing_subtypes`). It is applied ONLY to
narrowings whose endpoints genuinely vary between consumers; everything whose
subtypes both consumers guarantee stays strict, so a module dropped by accident
still fails loudly rather than silently composing fewer narrowings.
