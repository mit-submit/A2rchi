A2RCHI makes it easy to deploy AI assistants with a suite of tools that connect to communication platforms such as Piazza, Slack, Discourse, Mattermost, and email, and knowledge bases such as web links, files, JIRA tickets, and documentation. It is modular and extensible, allowing users to add connectors and customise pipeline behaviour for a wide range of tasks\u2014from answering simple questions to delivering detailed explanations. About A2RCHI is an end-to-end framework developed by Prof. Paus (MIT Physics), Prof. Kraska (MIT EECS), and their students. It has already been successfully deployed as a user chatbot and technical assistant at SubMIT (the MIT Physics Department's private cluster) and as an educational assistant for several MIT courses, including 8.01 and 8.511. What sets A2RCHI apart is that it is fully open source, configurable across foundational models and LLM libraries, and designed for private deployment. Under the hood, A2RCHI is a highly configurable RAG system tailored for educational and scientific support. Given its success, the scope now spans additional MIT classes, CERN, Harvard, and internal deployments such as CSAIL's support staff. Educational Support A2RCHI assists TAs, lecturers, and support staff\u2014or students directly\u2014by preparing answers based on curated class resources. In MIT course deployments, A2RCHI leverages Piazza posts, documentation, and other class-specific materials. The Piazza integration can draft answers for staff to review or send, while the system continuously learns from revisions and new posts, improving over time. Research Resource Support A2RCHI also serves technical support teams and end users. At SubMIT, it functions both as a user-facing chatbot and as a ticket assistant. Integration with Redmine enables A2RCHI to prepare draft responses to support tickets that staff can review before sending. In both roles, A2RCHI accesses the corpus of tickets and documentation, citing relevant sources in its answers.","title":"A2RCHI"},{"location":"#a2rchi","text":"A2RCHI (AI Augmented Research Chat Intelligence) is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to be a low-barrier, open-source, private, and customizable AI solution for research and educational support.

Helpful Notes for Production Deployments You may wish to use the CLI in order to stage production deployments. This section covers some useful notes to keep in mind. Running multiple deployments on the same machine The CLI allows multiple deployments to run on the same daemon in the case of Docker (Podman has no daemon). The container networks between all the deployments are separate, so there is very little risk of them accidentally communicating with one another. However, you need to be careful with the external ports. Suppose you're running two deployments and both of them are running the chat on external port 8000. There is no way to view both deployments at the same time from the same port, so instead you should forward the deployments to other external ports. Generally, this can be done in the configuration: services: chat_app: external_port: 7862 # default is 7861 uploader_app: external_port: 5004 # default is 5003 grafana: external_port: 3001 # default is 3000 chromadb: chromadb_external_port: 8001 # default is 8000 Persisting data between deployments Volumes persist between deployments, so if you deploy an instance and upload additional documents, you do not need to redo this every time you deploy.

DockerHub Images A2RCHI loads different base images hosted on Docker Hub. The Python base image is used when GPUs are not required; otherwise the PyTorch base image is used. The Dockerfiles for these base images live in src/cli/templates/dockerfiles/base-X-image . Images are hosted at: Python: https://hub.docker.com/r/a2rchi/a2rchi-python-base PyTorch: https://hub.docker.com/r/a2rchi/a2rchi-pytorch-base To rebuild a base image, navigate to the relevant base-xxx-image directory under src/cli/templates/dockerfiles/ . Each directory contains the Dockerfile, requirements, and license information. Regenerate the requirements files with: # Python image cat requirements/cpu-requirementsHEADER.txt requirements/requirements-base.txt > src/cli/templates/dockerfiles/base-python-image/requirements.txt # PyTorch image cat requirements/gpu-requirementsHEADER.txt requirements/requirements-base.txt > src/cli/templates/dockerfiles/base-pytorch-image/requirements.txt Build the image: podman build -t a2rchi/<image-name>:<tag> . After verifying the image, log in to Docker Hub (ask a senior developer for credentials): podman login docker.io Push the image: podman push a2rchi/<image-name>:<tag> Data Ingestion Architecture A2RCHI ingests content through sources which are collected by collectors ( data_manager/collectors ). These documents are written to persistent, local files via the PersistenceService , which uses Resource objects as an abstraction for different content types, and ResourceMetadata for associated metadata. A catalog of persisted files is maintained in index.yaml and metadata_index.yaml . Finally, the VectorStoreManager reads these files, splits them into chunks, generates embeddings, and indexes them in ChromaDB. Resources and BaseResource Every collected artifact from the collectors is represented as a subclass of BaseResource ( src/data_manager/collectors/resource_base.py ). Subclasses must implement: get_hash() : a stable identifier used as the key in the filesystem catalog. get_filename() : the on-disk file name (including extension). get_content() : returns the textual or binary payload that should be persisted. Resources may optionally override: get_metadata() : returns a metadata object (typically ResourceMetadata ) describing the item. Keys should be serialisable strings and are flattened into the vector store metadata. get_metadata_path() : inherited helper that derives a .meta.yaml path when metadata is present. ResourceMetadata ( src/data_manager/collectors/utils/metadata.py ) enforces a required display_name and normalises the extra dictionary so all values become strings. Use this to expose source-specific information such as URLs, ticket identifiers, or visibility flags. The guiding philosophy is that resources describe content , but never write to disk themselves. This separation keeps collectors simple, testable, and ensures consistent validation when persisting different resource types. Persistence Service PersistenceService ( src/data_manager/collectors/persistence.py ) centralises all filesystem writes for both the document content, and its metadata. When persist_resource() is called it: Resolves the target path under the configured DATA_PATH . Validates and writes the resource content (rejecting empty payloads or unknown types). Serialises metadata, if provided, to an adjacent *.meta.yaml file. Updates two catalogs: index.yaml : maps each resource hash to the content file path. metadata_index.yaml : maps resource hashes to the metadata file path. Collectors only interact with PersistenceService ; they should not touch the filesystem directly. Vector Database The vector store lives under the data_manager/vectorstore package. VectorStoreManager reads the persistence catalogs and synchronises them with ChromaDB: Loads the tracked files and metadata hashes from index.yaml . Splits documents into chunks, optional stemming, and builds embeddings via the configured model. Adds chunks to the Chroma collection with flattened metadata (including resource hash, filename, human-readable display fields, and any source-specific extras). Deletes stale entries when the underlying files disappear or are superseded. Because the manager defers to the catalog, any resource persisted through PersistenceService automatically becomes eligible for indexing\u2014no extra plumbing is required. Extending the stack When integrating a new source, create a collector under data_manager/collectors . Collectors should yield Resource objects. A new Resource subclass is only needed if the content type is not already represented (e.g., text, HTML, markdown, images, etc.), but it must implement the required methods described above. When integrating a new collector, ensure that any per-source configuration is encoded in the resource metadata so downstream consumers\u2014such as the chat app\u2014can honour it.

Keys should be serialisable strings and are flattened into the vector store metadata. get_metadata_path() : inherited helper that derives a .meta.yaml path when metadata is present. ResourceMetadata ( src/data_manager/collectors/utils/metadata.py ) enforces a required display_name and normalises the extra dictionary so all values become strings.

These include: Links lists (even behind SSO) : automatically scrape and ingest documents from a list of URLs Git scraping : git mkdocs repositories Ticketing systems : JIRA, Redmine, Piazza Local documents Additionally, A2RCHI supports various interfaces/services , which are applications that interact with the RAG system. These include: Chat interface : a web-based chat application Piazza integration : read posts from Piazza and post draft responses to a Slack channel Cleo/Redmine integration : read emails and create tickets in Redmine Mattermost integration : read posts from Mattermost and post draft responses to a Mattermost channel Grafana monitoring dashboard : monitor system and LLM performance metrics Document uploader : web interface for uploading and managing documents Grader : automated grading service for assignments with web interface Both data sources and interfaces/services are enabled via flags to the a2rchi create command, a2rchi create [...] --services=chatbot,piazza,... --sources jira,redmine,... The parameters of the services and sources are configured via the configuration file. See below for more details. We support various pipelines which are pre-defined sequences of operations that process user inputs and generate responses. Each service may support a given pipeline. See the Services and Pipelines sections below for more details. For each pipeline, you can use different models, retrievers, and prompts for different steps of the pipeline. We support various models for both embeddings and LLMs, which can be run locally or accessed via APIs. See the Models section below for more details. Both pipelines and models are configured via the configuration file. Finally, we support various retrievers and embedding techniques for document retrieval. These are configured via the configuration file. See the Vector Store section below for more details. Optional command line options In addition to the required --name , --config/--config-dir , --env-file , and --services arguments, the a2rchi create command accepts several useful flags: --podman : Run the deployment with Podman instead of Docker. --sources / -src : Enable additional ingestion sources ( git , sso , jira , redmine , ...). Provide a comma-separated list. --gpu-ids : Mount specific GPUs ( --gpu-ids all or --gpu-ids 0,1 ). The legacy --gpu flag still works but maps to all . --tag : Override the local image tag (defaults to 2000 ). Handy when building multiple configurations side-by-side. --hostmode : Use host networking for all services. --verbosity / -v : Control CLI logging level (0 = quiet, 4 = debug). --force / --dry-run : Force recreation of an existing deployment and/or show what would happen without actually deploying. You can inspect the available services and sources, together with descriptions, using a2rchi list-services . GPU helpers GPU access requires the NVIDIA drivers plus the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. After installing the toolkit, generate CDI entries (for Podman) with sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml and confirm with nvidia-ctk cdi list . Docker users should run sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker . Data Sources These are the different ways to ingest data into the vector store used for document retrieval. Web Link Lists A web link list is a simple text file containing a list of URLs, one per line. A2RCHI will fetch the content from each URL and add it to the vector store, using the Scraper class. Configuration You can define which lists of links A2RCHI will ingest in the configuration file as follows: data_manager: sources: links: input_lists: # REQUIRED - miscellanea.list # list of websites with relevant info - [...other lists...] Each list should be a simple text file containing one URL per line, e.g., https://example.com/page1 https://example.com/page2 [...] In the case that some of the links are behind a Single Sign-On (SSO) system, enable the SSO source in your configuration and specify the collector class: data_manager: sources: sso: enabled: true sso_class: CERNSSOScraper # or whichever class is appropriate sso_class_map: CERNSSOScraper: kwargs: headless: true max_depth: 2 Then, run a2rchi create ... --sources sso to activate the SSO collector. You can customise the HTTP scraper behaviour (for example, to avoid SSL verification warnings): data_manager: sources: links: scraper: reset_data: true verify_urls: false enable_warnings: false Secrets If you are using SSO, depending on the class, you may need to provide your login credentials in a secrets file as follows: SSO_USERNAME=username SSO_PASSWORD=password Then, make sure that the links you provide in the .list file(s) start with sso- , e.g., sso-https://example.com/protected/page Running Link scraping is automatically enabled in A2RCHI, you don't need to add any arguments to the create command unless the links are sso protected. Git scraping In some cases, the RAG input may be documentations based on MKDocs git repositories. Instead of scraping these sites as regular HTML sites you can obtain the relevant content using the GitScraper class. Configuration To configure it, enable the git source in the configuration file: data_manager: sources: git: enabled: true In the input lists, make sure to prepend git- to the URL of the repositories you are interested in scraping. git-https://github.com/example/mkdocs/documentation.git Secrets You will need to provide a git username and token in the secrets file, GIT_USERNAME=your_username GIT_TOKEN=your_token Running Enable the git source during deployment with --sources git . JIRA The JIRA integration allows A2RCHI to fetch issues and comments from specified JIRA projects and add them to the vector store, using the JiraClient class. Configuration Select which projects to scrape in the configuration file: data_manager: sources: jira: url: https://jira.example.com projects: - PROJECT_KEY anonymize_data: true You can further customise anonymisation via the global anonymiser settings. data_manager: utils: anonymizer: nlp_model: en_core_web_sm excluded_words: - Example greeting_patterns: - '^(hi|hello|hey|greetings|dear)\\b' signoff_patterns: - '\\b(regards|sincerely|best regards|cheers|thank you)\\b' email_pattern: '[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+' username_pattern: '\\[~[^\\]]+\\]' The anonymizer will remove names, emails, usernames, greetings, signoffs, and any other words you specify from the fetched data. This is useful if you want to avoid having personal information in the vector store. Secrets A personal access token (PAT) is required to authenticate and authorize with JIRA. Add JIRA_PAT=<token> to your .env file before deploying with --sources jira . Running Enable the source at deploy time with: a2rchi create [...] --services=chatbot --sources jira Adding Documents and the Uploader Interface Adding Documents There are two main ways to add documents to A2RCHI's vector database. They are: Manually adding files while the service is running via the uploader GUI Directly copying files into the container These methods are outlined below. Manual Uploader In order to upload documents while A2RCHI is running via an easily accessible GUI, enable the uploader service when creating the deployment: a2rchi create [...] --services=chatbot,uploader The exact port may vary based on configuration (default external port is 5003 ). A quick podman ps or docker ps will show which port is exposed. In order to access the manager, you must first create an admin account. Grab the container ID with podman ps / docker ps and then enter the container: docker exec -it <CONTAINER-ID> bash Run the bundled helper: python -u src/bin/service_create_account.py from the /root/A2RCHI directory inside the container. This script will guide you through creating an account; never reuse sensitive passwords here. Once you have created an account, visit the outgoing port of the data manager docker service and then log in. The GUI will then allow you to upload documents while A2RCHI is still running. Note that it may take a few minutes for all the documents to upload. Directly copying files to the container The documents used for RAG live in the chat container at /root/data/<directory>/<files> . Thus, in a pinch, you can docker/podman cp a file at this directory level, e.g., podman/docker cp myfile.pdf <container name or ID>:/root/data/<new_dir>/ . If you need to make a new directory in the container, you can do podman exec -it <container name or ID> mkdir /root/data/<new_dir> . Redmine Use the Redmine source to ingest solved tickets (question/answer pairs) into the vector store. Configuration data_manager: sources: redmine: url: https://redmine.example.com project: my-project anonymize_data: true Secrets Add the following to your .env file: REDMINE_USER=... REDMINE_PW=... Running Enable the source at deploy time with: a2rchi create [...] --services=chatbot --sources redmine To automate email replies, also enable the redmine-mailer service (see the Services section below). Interfaces/Services These are the different apps that A2RCHI supports, which allow you to interact with the AI pipelines. Piazza Interface Set up A2RCHI to read posts from your Piazza forum and post draft responses to a specified Slack channel. To do this, a Piazza login (email and password) is required, plus the network ID of your Piazza channel, and lastly, a Webhook for the slack channel A2RCHI will post to. See below for a step-by-step description of this. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and sign in to workspace where you will eventually want A2RCHI to post to (note doing this in a business workspace like the MIT one will require approval of the app/bot). Click 'Create New App', and then 'From scratch'. Name your app and again select the correct workspace. Then hit 'Create App' Now you have your app, and there are a few things to configure before you can launch A2RCHI: Go to Incoming Webhooks under Features, and toggle it on. Click 'Add New Webhook', and select the channel you want A2RCHI to post to. Now, copy the 'Webhook URL' and paste it into the secrets file, and handle it like any other secret! Configuration Beyond standard required configuration fields, the network ID of the Piazza channel is required (see below for an example config). You can get the network ID by simply navigating to the class homepage, and grabbing the sequence that follows 'https://piazza.com/class/'. For example, the 8.01 Fall 2024 homepage is: 'https://piazza.com/class/m0g3v0ahsqm2lg'. The network ID is thus 'm0g3v0ahsqm2lg'. Example minimal config for the Piazza interface: name: bare_minimum_configuration #REQUIRED data_manager: sources: links: input_lists: - class_info.list # class info links a2rchi: [... a2rchi config ...] services: piazza: network_id: <your Piazza network ID here> # REQUIRED chat_app: trained_on: \"Your class materials\" # REQUIRED Secrets The necessary secrets for deploying the Piazza service are the following: PIAZZA_EMAIL=... PIAZZA_PASSWORD=... SLACK_WEBHOOK=... The Slack webhook secret is described above. The Piazza email and password should be those of one of the class instructors. Remember to put this information in files named following what is written above. Running To run the Piazza service, simply add the piazza flag. For example: a2rchi create [...] --services=chatbot,piazza Redmine/Mailbox Interface A2RCHI will read all new tickets in a Redmine project, and draft a response as a comment to the ticket. Once the ticket is updated to the \"Resolved\" status by an admin, A2RCHI will send the response as an email to the user who opened the ticket. The admin can modify A2RCHI's response before sending it out. Configuration services: redmine_mailbox: url: https://redmine.example.com project: my-project redmine_update_time: 10 mailbox_update_time: 10 answer_tag: \"-- A2RCHI -- Resolving email was sent\" Secrets Add the following secrets to your .env file: IMAP_USER=... IMAP_PW=... REDMINE_USER=... REDMINE_PW=... SENDER_SERVER=... SENDER_PORT=587 SENDER_REPLYTO=... SENDER_USER=... SENDER_PW=... Running a2rchi create [...] --services=chatbot,redmine-mailer Mattermost Interface Set up A2RCHI to read posts from your Mattermost forum and post draft responses to a specified Mattermost channel. Configuration services: mattermost: update_time: 60 Secrets You need to specify a webhook, access token, and channel identifiers: MATTERMOST_WEBHOOK=... MATTERMOST_PAK=... MATTERMOST_CHANNEL_ID_READ=... MATTERMOST_CHANNEL_ID_WRITE=... Running To run the Mattermost service, include it when selecting services. For example: a2rchi create [...] --services=chatbot,mattermost Grafana Interface Monitor the performance of your A2RCHI instance with the Grafana interface. This service provides a web-based dashboard to visualize various metrics related to system performance, LLM usage, and more. Note, if you are deploying a version of A2RCHI you have already used (i.e., you haven't removed the images/volumes for a given --name ), the postgres will have already been created without the Grafana user created, and it will not work, so make sure to deploy a fresh instance. Configuration services: grafana: external_port: 3000 Secrets Grafana shares the Postgres database with other services, so you need both the database password and a Grafana-specific password: PG_PASSWORD=<your_database_password> GRAFANA_PG_PASSWORD=<grafana_db_password> Running Deploy Grafana alongside your other services: a2rchi create [...] --services=chatbot,grafana and you should see something like this CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES d27482864238 localhost/chromadb-gtesting2:2000 uvicorn chromadb.... 9 minutes ago Up 9 minutes (healthy) 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp, 8000/tcp chromadb-gtesting2 87f1c7289d29 docker.io/library/postgres:16 postgres 9 minutes ago Up 9 minutes (healthy) 5432/tcp postgres-gtesting2 40130e8e23de docker.io/library/grafana-gtesting2:2000 9 minutes ago Up 9 minutes 0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp, 3000/tcp grafana-gtesting2 d6ce8a149439 localhost/chat-gtesting2:2000 python -u a2rchi/... 9 minutes ago Up 9 minutes 0.0.0.0:7861->7861/tcp chat-gtesting2 where the grafana interface is accessible at your-hostname:3000 . To change the external port from 3000 , you can do this in the config at services.grafana.external_port . The default login and password are both \"admin\", which you will be prompted to change should you want to after first logging in. Navigate to the A2RCHI dashboard from the home page by going to the menu > Dashboards > A2RCHI > A2RCHI Usage. Note, your-hostname here is the just name of the machine. Grafana uses its default configuration which is localhost but unlike the chat interface, there are no APIs where we template with a selected hostname, so the container networking handles this nicely. Pro tip: once at the web interface, for the \"Recent Conversation Messages (Clean Text + Link)\" panel, click the three little dots in the top right hand corner of the panel, click \"Edit\", and on the right, go to e.g., \"Override 4\" (should have Fields with name: clean text, also Override 7 for context column) and override property \"Cell options > Cell value inspect\". This will allow you to expand the text boxes with messages longer than can fit. Make sure you click apply to keep the changes. Pro tip 2: If you want to download all of the information from any panel as a CSV, go to the same three dots and click \"Inspect\", and you should see the option. Grader Interface Interface to launch a website which for a provided solution and rubric (and a couple of other things detailed below), will grade scanned images of a handwritten solution for the specified problem(s). Nota bene: this is not yet fully generalized and \"service\" ready, but instead for testing grading pipelines and a base off of which to build a potential grading app. Requirements To launch the service the following files are required: users.csv . This file is .csv file that contains two columns: \"MIT email\" and \"Unique code\", e.g.: MIT email,Unique code username@mit.edu,222 For now, the system requires the emails to be in the MIT domain, namely, contain \"@mit.edu\". TODO: make this an argument that is passed (e.g., school/email domain) solution_with_rubric_*.txt . These are .txt files that contain the problem solution followed by the rubric. The naming of the files should follow exactly, where the * is the problem number. There should be one of these files for every problem you want the app to be able to grade. The top of the file should be the problem name with a line of dashes (\"-\") below, e.g.: Anti-Helmholtz Coils --------------------------------------------------- These files should live in a directory which you will pass to the config, and A2RCHI will handle the rest. admin_password.txt . This file will be passed as a secret and be the admin code to login in to the page where you can reset attempts for students. Secrets The only grading specific secret is the admin password, which like shown above, should be put in the following file ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password Then it behaves like any other secret. Configuration The required fields in the configuration file are different from the rest of the A2RCHI services. Below is an example: name: grading_test # REQUIRED a2rchi: pipelines: - GradingPipeline pipeline_map: GradingPipeline: prompts: required: final_grade_prompt: final_grade.prompt models: required: final_grade_model: OllamaInterface ImageProcessingPipeline: prompts: required: image_processing_prompt: image_processing.prompt models: required: image_processing_model: OllamaInterface services: chat_app: trained_on: \"rubrics, class info, etc.\" # REQUIRED grader_app: num_problems: 1 # REQUIRED local_rubric_dir: ~/grading/my_rubrics # REQUIRED local_users_csv_dir: ~/grading/logins # REQUIRED data_manager: [...] name -- The name of your configuration (required). a2rchi.pipelines -- List of pipelines to use (e.g., GradingPipeline , ImageProcessingPipeline ). a2rchi.pipeline_map -- Mapping of pipelines to their required prompts and models. a2rchi.pipeline_map.GradingPipeline.prompts.required.final_grade_prompt -- Path to the grading prompt file for evaluating student solutions. a2rchi.pipeline_map.GradingPipeline.models.required.final_grade_model -- Model class for grading (e.g., OllamaInterface , HuggingFaceOpenLLM ). a2rchi.pipeline_map.ImageProcessingPipeline.prompts.required.image_processing_prompt -- Path to the prompt file for image processing. a2rchi.pipeline_map.ImageProcessingPipeline.models.required.image_processing_model -- Model class for image processing (e.g., OllamaInterface , HuggingFaceImageLLM ). services.chat_app.trained_on -- A brief description of the data or materials A2RCHI is trained on (required). services.grader_app.num_problems -- Number of problems the grading service should expect (must match the number of rubric files). services.grader_app.local_rubric_dir -- Directory containing the solution_with_rubric_*.txt files. services.grader_app.local_users_csv_dir -- Directory containing the users.csv file. Running a2rchi create [...] --services=grader Models Models are either: Hosted locally, either via VLLM or HuggingFace transformers. Accessed via an API, e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. Accessed via an Ollama server instance. Local Models To use a local model, specify one of the local model classes in models.py : HuggingFaceOpenLLM HuggingFaceImageLLM VLLM Models via APIs We support the following model classes in models.py for models accessed via APIs: OpenAILLM AnthropicLLM Ollama In order to use an Ollama server instance for the chatbot, it is possible to specify OllamaInterface for the model name. To then correctly use models on the Ollama server, in the keyword args, specify both the url of the server and the name of a model hosted on the server. a2rchi: model_class_map: OllamaInterface: kwargs: base_model: \"gemma3\" # example url: \"url-for-server\" In this case, the gemma3 model is hosted on the Ollama server at url-for-server . You can check which models are hosted on your server by going to url-for-server/models . Vector Store The vector store is a database that stores document embeddings, enabling semantic and/or lexical search over your knowledge base. A2RCHI uses ChromaDB as the vector store backend to index and retrieve relevant documents based on similarity to user queries. Configuration Vector store settings are configured under the data_manager section: data_manager: collection_name: default_collection embedding_name: OpenAIEmbeddings chunk_size: 1000 chunk_overlap: 0 reset_collection: true num_documents_to_retrieve: 5 distance_metric: cosine Core Settings collection_name : Name of the ChromaDB collection. Default: default_collection chunk_size : Maximum size of text chunks (in characters) when splitting documents. Default: 1000 chunk_overlap : Number of overlapping characters between consecutive chunks. Default: 0 reset_collection : If true , deletes and recreates the collection on startup. Default: true num_documents_to_retrieve : Number of relevant document chunks to retrieve for each query. Default: 5 Distance Metrics The distance_metric determines how similarity is calculated between embeddings: cosine : Cosine similarity (default) - measures the angle between vectors l2 : Euclidean distance - measures straight-line distance ip : Inner product - measures dot product similarity data_manager: distance_metric: cosine # Options: cosine, l2, ip Embedding Models Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors. A2RCHI supports multiple embedding providers: OpenAI Embeddings data_manager: embedding_name: OpenAIEmbeddings embedding_class_map: OpenAIEmbeddings: class: OpenAIEmbeddings kwargs: model: text-embedding-3-small similarity_score_reference: 10 HuggingFace Embeddings data_manager: embedding_name: HuggingFaceEmbeddings embedding_class_map: HuggingFaceEmbeddings: class: HuggingFaceEmbeddings kwargs: model_name: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model_kwargs: device: cpu encode_kwargs: normalize_embeddings: true similarity_score_reference: 10 query_embedding_instructions: null Supported Document Formats The vector store can process the following file types: Text files : .txt , .C Markdown : .md Python : .py HTML : .html PDF : .pdf Documents are automatically loaded with the appropriate parser based on file extension. Document Synchronization A2RCHI automatically synchronizes your data directory with the vector store: Adding documents : New files in the data directory are automatically chunked, embedded, and added to the collection Removing documents : Files deleted from the data directory are removed from the collection Source tracking : Each ingested artifact is recorded in the unified index.yaml file as <resource-hash>: <relative file path> inside the data directory Hybrid Search Combine semantic search with keyword-based BM25 search for improved retrieval: data_manager: use_hybrid_search: true bm25_weight: 0.6 semantic_weight: 0.4 bm25: k1: 0.5 b: 0.75 use_hybrid_search : Enable hybrid search combining BM25 and semantic similarity. Default: false bm25_weight : Weight for BM25 keyword scores. Default: 0.6 semantic_weight : Weight for semantic similarity scores. Default: 0.4 bm25.k1 : BM25 term frequency saturation parameter. Default: 0.5 bm25.b : BM25 document length normalization parameter. Default: 0.75 Stemming By specifying the stemming option within your configuration, stemming functionality for the documents in A2RCHI will be enabled. By doing so, documents inserted into the retrieval pipeline, as well as the query that is matched with them, will be stemmed and simplified for faster and more accurate lookup. data_manager: stemming: enabled: true When enabled, both documents and queries are processed using the Porter Stemmer algorithm to reduce words to their root forms (e.g., \"running\" \u2192 \"run\"), improving matching accuracy. ChromaDB Backend A2RCHI supports both local and remote ChromaDB instances: Local (Persistent) services: chromadb: local_vstore_path: /path/to/vectorstore Remote (HTTP Client) services: chromadb: use_HTTP_chromadb_client: true chromadb_host: localhost chromadb_port: 8000 Benchmarking A2RCHI has benchmarking functionality provided by the evaluate CLI command. We currently support two modes: SOURCES : given a user question and a list of correct sources, check if the retrieved documents contain any of the correct sources. RAGAS : use the Ragas RAG evaluator module to return numerical values judging by 4 of their provided metrics the quality of the answer: answer_relevancy , faithfulness , context precision , and context relevancy . Preparing the queries file Provide your list of questions, answers, and relevant sources in JSON format as follows: [ { \"question\": \"\", \"sources\": [...], \"answer\": \"\" // (optional) \"sources_match_field\": [...] }, ... ] Explanation of fields: - question : The question to be answered by the A2RCHI instance. - sources : A list of sources (e.g., URLs, ticket IDs) that contain the answer. They are identified via the sources_match_field , which must be one of the metadata fields of the documents in your vector store. - answer : The expected answer to the question, used for evaluation. - sources_match_field (optional): A list of metadata fields to match the sources against (e.g., url , ticket_id ). If not provided, defaults to what is in the configuration file under data_manager:services:benchmarking:mode_settings:sources:default_match_field . Example: (see also examples/benchmarking/queries.json ) [ { \"question\": \"Does Jorian Benke work with the PPC and what topic will she work on?\", \"sources\": [\"https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2025/07/14/welcome-our-first-ever-in-house-masters-student/\", \"CMSPROD-42\"], \"answer\": \"Yes, Jorian works with the PPC and her topic is the study of Lorentz invariance.\", \"source_match_field\": [\"url\", \"ticket_id\"] }, ... ] N.B.: one could also provide the url for the JIRA ticket: it is just a choice that you must make, and detail in source_match_field . i.e., the following will evaluate equivalently as the above example: [ { \"question\": \"Does Jorian Benke work with the PPC and what topic will she work on?\", \"sources\": [\"https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2025/07/14/welcome-our-first-ever-in-house-masters-student/\", \"https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSPROD-42\"], \"answer\": \"Yes, Jorian works with the PPC and her topic is the study of Lorentz invariance.\", \"source_match_field\": [\"url\", \"url\"] }, ... ] Configuration You can evaluate one or more configurations by specifying the evaluate command with the -cd flag pointing to the directory containing your configuration file(s). You can also specify individual files with the -c flag. This can be useful if you're interested in comparing different hyperparameter settings. We support two modes, which you can specify in the configuration file under services:benchmarking:modes . You can choose either or both of RAGAS and SOURCES . The RAGAS mode will use the Ragas RAG evaluator module to return numerical values judging by 4 of their provided metrics: answer_relevancy , faithfulness , context precision , and context relevancy . More information about these metrics can be found on the Ragas website . The SOURCES mode will check if the retrieved documents contain any of the correct sources. The matching is done by comparing a given metadata field for any source. The default is display_name , as per the configuration file ( data_manager:services:benchmarking:mode_settings:sources:default_match_field ). You can override this on a per-query basis by specifying the sources_match_field field in the queries file, as described above. The configuration file should look like the following: services: benchmarking: queries_path: examples/benchmarking/queries.json out_dir: bench_out modes: - \"RAGAS\" - \"SOURCES\" mode_settings: sources: default_match_field: [\"display_name\"] # default field to match sources against, can be overridden in the queries file ragas_settings: provider: <provider name> # can be one of OpenAI, HuggingFace, Ollama, and Anthropic evaluation_model_settings: model_name: <model name> # ensure this lines up with the langchain API name for your chosen model and provider base_url: <url> # address to your running Ollama server should you have chosen the Ollama provider embedding_model: <embedding provider> # OpenAI or HuggingFace Finally, before you run the command ensure out_dir , the output directory, both exists on your system and that the path is correctly specified so that results can show up inside of it. Running To run the benchmarking script simply run the following: a2rchi evaluate -n <name> -e <env_file> -cd <configs_directory> <optionally use -c <file1>,<file2>, ...> <OPTIONS> Example: a2rchi evaluate -n benchmark -c examples/benchmarking/benchmark_configs/example_conf.yaml --gpu-ids all Additional options You might also want to adjust the timeout setting, which is the upper limit on how long the Ragas evaluation takes on a single QA pair, or the batch_size , which determines how many QA pairs to evaluate at once, which you might want to adjust, e.g., based on hardware constraints, as Ragas doesn't pay great attention to that. The corresponding configuration options are similarly set for the benchmarking services, as follows: services: benchmarking: timeout: <time in seconds> # default is 180 batch_size: <desired batch size> # no default setting, set by Ragas... Results The output of the benchmarking will be saved in the out_dir specified in the configuration file. The results will be saved in a timestamped subdirectory, e.g., bench_out/2042-10-01_12-00-00/ . To later examine your data, check out scripts/benchmarking/ , which contains some plotting functions and an ipynotebook with some basic usage examples. This is useful to play around with the results of the benchmarking, we will soon also have instead dedicated scripts to produce the plots of interest. Other Some useful additional features supported by the framework. Add ChromaDB Document Management API Endpoints Debugging ChromaDB endpoints Debugging REST API endpoints to the A2RCHI chat application for programmatic access to the ChromaDB vector database can be exposed with the following configuration change. To enable the ChromaDB endpoints, add the following to your config file under services.chat_app : services: chat_app: # ... other config options ... enable_debug_chroma_endpoints: true # Default: false ChromaDB Endpoints Info # /api/list_docs (GET) Lists all documents indexed in ChromaDB with pagination support.
