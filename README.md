A2RCHI is a retrieval-augmented generation framework for research and education teams who need a low-barrier to entry, configurable, private, and extensible assistant. The system was first developed at MIT for the SubMIT computing project, and now powers chat, ticketing, and course-support workflows across academia and research organizations.

## Key Capabilities

A2RCHI provides:
- Customizable AI pipelines that combine data retrieval and LLMs (and more tools to come!).
- Data ingestion connectors: web links, git repositories, local files, JIRA, and more.
- Interfaces: chat app, ticketing assistant, email bot, and more.
- Support for running or interacting with local and API-based LLMs.
- Modular design that allows custom data sources, LLM backends, and deployment targets.
- Containerized services and CLI utilities for repeatable deployments.
