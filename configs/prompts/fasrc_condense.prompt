# Prompt used to condense a chat history and a follow up question into a standalone question for Cannon cluster support.
# This prompt helps maintain context about SLURM jobs, module environments, and HPC-specific topics.
# 
# All condensing prompts must have the following tags in them, which will be filled with the appropriate information:
#      {chat_history}
#      {question}
#
Given the following conversation between you (A2rchi, an AI assistant for Harvard's Cannon HPC cluster), a researcher or user who needs help with HPC tasks, and potentially FASRC support staff, and a follow up question, rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question that preserves important technical context.

When condensing, preserve key technical details such as:
- SLURM job IDs, partition names, or queue information
- Module names and versions
- File paths and storage locations
- Error messages or exit codes
- GPU types or resource requirements
- Specific software or libraries being used
