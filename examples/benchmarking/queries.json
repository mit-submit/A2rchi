    "sources": ["https://ppc.mit.edu/daq-storage-manager/"],
    "answer": "The European Commission’s backing of the Future Circular Collider (FCC) is pivotal because it signals Europe’s intent to remain a global leader in particle physics. By proposing Horizon Europe funding of up to 20 % of the FCC’s cost, the Commission provides critical political and financial support for a decades-long, multi-billion-euro project. This commitment not only enables potential breakthroughs beyond the Standard Model—such as precision Higgs measurements and dark matter searches—but also strengthens Europe’s innovation ecosystem through advanced technologies and industry spin-offs",

    "sources": ["https://ppc.mit.edu/daq-storage-manager/"],
    "answer": "The text draws a playful parallel between Daft Punk’s song “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” and the European Commission’s Horizon Europe proposal. It notes that, following the Venice Symposium on particle physics strategy, the Commission—under Ursula von der Leyen—appears to be “taking a page out of Daft Punk’s playbook” by branding the 2028–2034 Horizon Europe budget as “Bigger, Simpler, Faster, and More Impactful.” This comparison emphasizes the ambitious, transformative tone of the proposal, echoing the song’s theme of continual improvement",

    "sources": ["https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2024/10/06/the-cms-heavy-ion-run-in-2024/"],
    "answer": "The existing system, using Filter Units (FUs), Builder Units (BUs), and Lustre, can handle only 18–19 GB/s, which is much smaller than the ~30 GB/s required. This limitation prompted the PPC team to create a new, parallel data flow.",

    "sources": ["https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2024/10/06/the-cms-heavy-ion-run-in-2024/"],
    "answer": "In the new system: Files from the FUs are sent to a single machine’s RAM disk for merging, rather than 60 BUs writing in parallel to Lustre. The merged file is stored on the same machine’s special disk, not on Lustre. The buffer on each machine is small (a few TBs, less than an hour of data-taking), so merging and transfer must happen without delay, and files are deleted immediately after transfer.",
