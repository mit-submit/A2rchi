"answer": "The Future Circular Collider (FCC) is highlighted as a top-priority “Moonshot” project within the Horizon Europe 2028–2034 budget proposal. The European Commission explicitly mentions investing in CERN’s FCC—alongside other participating countries—as part of its plan to maintain Europe’s leadership in particle physics research."
},

{
"question": "What percentage of the FCC’s cost could potentially be funded through Horizon Europe?", 
"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/daq-storage-manager/",
"answer": "Up to 20 % of the FCC’s overall cost could potentially be funded through Horizon Europe"
},

{
"question": "Why is the European Commission’s support for the FCC considered significant for particle physics?", 
"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/daq-storage-manager/",
"answer": "The European Commission’s backing of the Future Circular Collider (FCC) is pivotal because it signals Europe’s intent to remain a global leader in particle physics. By proposing Horizon Europe funding of up to 20 % of the FCC’s cost, the Commission provides critical political and financial support for a decades-long, multi-billion-euro project. This commitment not only enables potential breakthroughs beyond the Standard Model—such as precision Higgs measurements and dark matter searches—but also strengthens Europe’s innovation ecosystem through advanced technologies and industry spin-offs"

"question": "How does the text relate the Horizon Europe proposal to Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger”?" 
,"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/daq-storage-manager/",
"answer": "The text draws a playful parallel between Daft Punk’s song “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” and the European Commission’s Horizon Europe proposal. It notes that, following the Venice Symposium on particle physics strategy, the Commission—under Ursula von der Leyen—appears to be “taking a page out of Daft Punk’s playbook” by branding the 2028–2034 Horizon Europe budget as “Bigger, Simpler, Faster, and More Impactful.” This comparison emphasizes the ambitious, transformative tone of the proposal, echoing the song’s theme of continual improvement"

"question": "What are the main physics goals of the CMS heavy-ion program during Run 3?", 
"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2024/10/06/the-cms-heavy-ion-run-in-2024/",
"answer": "CMS’s heavy-ion physics program focuses on measuring jet quenching, quarkonium suppression, heavy-flavor production, flow correlations, and forward physics. Many of these goals involve studying rare probes of the quark–gluon plasma and require large data samples."
},

{
"question": "How much integrated luminosity does the heavy-ion community aim to collect in Run 3?", 
"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2024/10/06/the-cms-heavy-ion-run-in-2024/",
"answer": "The goal for Run 3 is about 6/nb of integrated luminosity."

{
"question": "Why are large numbers of minimum-bias events important for certain studies?", 
"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2024/10/06/the-cms-heavy-ion-run-in-2024/",
"answer": "Heavy-flavor and particle-correlation studies cannot be accessed with specific online triggers, so a significant amount of minimum-bias data events is required to explore these observables effectively."
},

{
"question": "What is the estimated number of UPC events required for the ultra-peripheral collision (UPC) program?", 
"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2024/10/06/the-cms-heavy-ion-run-in-2024/",
"answer": "The UPC program is estimated to need about 50 billion UPC events."

{
"question": "How many minimum-bias and UPC events were recorded during the 2023 PbPb run?", 
"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2024/10/06/the-cms-heavy-ion-run-in-2024/",
"answer": "During the five-week 2023 PbPb run, CMS recorded 15 billion minimum-bias events and 10 billion UPC events."
},

{
"question": "What data reduction techniques have been implemented, and by what percentage has event size been reduced?", 
"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2024/10/06/the-cms-heavy-ion-run-in-2024/",
"answer": "Sophisticated data reduction techniques and data compression have been applied, achieving a 54% reduction in event size."

{
"question": "What limitations of the existing storage manager and transfer system led to the development of a new data flow?", 
"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2024/10/06/the-cms-heavy-ion-run-in-2024/",
"answer": "The existing system, using Filter Units (FUs), Builder Units (BUs), and Lustre, can handle only 18–19 GB/s, which is much smaller than the ~30 GB/s required. This limitation prompted the PPC team to create a new, parallel data flow."
},

{
"question": "How does the new parallel data flow differ from the previous approach?", 
"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2024/10/06/the-cms-heavy-ion-run-in-2024/",
"answer": "In the new system: Files from the FUs are sent to a single machine’s RAM disk for merging, rather than 60 BUs writing in parallel to Lustre. The merged file is stored on the same machine’s special disk, not on Lustre. The buffer on each machine is small (a few TBs, less than an hour of data-taking), so merging and transfer must happen without delay, and files are deleted immediately after transfer."
},

{
"question": "What hardware upgrades support higher data rates in the new system, and what rate increase do they enable?", 
"link": "https://ppc.mit.edu/blog/2024/10/06/the-cms-heavy-ion-run-in-2024/",
"answer": "Special 7 TB SSDs (two per machine) were purchased for fast merging and transfer. With eight machines each capable of ~2 GB/s, this adds 15–16 GB/s to the total data rate capacity."
